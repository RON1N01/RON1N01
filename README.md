## What I do
- Build small, reliable tools that reduce analyst friction (time normalization, parsing, shell automation).
- Train like an operator: fundamentals, repeatable workflows, clean documentation, and measurable drills.
- Work fluently in CLI-first environments (macOS + Linux) and keep configs versioned and portable.  (https://github.com/RON1N01/.dotfiles)

## Core strengths
- Identity and endpoint operations mindset (authentication, access, auditability, and investigation workflows).
- Shell and systems fundamentals (bash primitives, repeatable automation patterns).
- Documentation as a deliverable: lab notes structured for replay and learning transfer.  (https://github.com/RON1N01/shell-primitives)
